First we look for the longest gram,say trigram, if the trigram exists, then the first number in ARFA n gram format is the probability of the w3 given the history of
word w1 and w2. if the trigram doesn't exist, it simply backs off to the two bigrams and they are P(w3|w2) and P(w2|w1),and the back-off works in two ways:  when trigram
w1,w2,w3 backing off to bigram w2,w3, one situation is if the bigram w1,w2 exists then the right number in ARFA n gram format as the weight W(w1,w2) is used to multiply
the probability of back-off bigram p(w3|w2), the other is the when bigram history w1 and w2 doesn't exist then we just use the probability of P(w3|w2) directly. vice versa
we treat the other back-off bigram w1,w2. If this bigram exists then we just simply use the conditional probability of the bigram ( 1st number in the ARFA format), if it
doesn't exist then the bigram backs off to unigram w2 and use w1 as weight W(w1).

w1,w2,w3 if exists, then the P(trigram)
         if it doesn't exist,back off to bigram w1,w2 and bigram w2,w3 
                   # bigram w2 w3
			   if   history bigram w1 w2 exists then use weight (w1,w2) * P(w3|w2)
                      	   else history bigram w1 w2 doesnâ€™t exist, then just simply use the P(w3|w2)
                   # bigram w1 2 
		           if   bigram w1 w2 exists then use the probability p(w2|w1)
			   else backs off to unigram w2 and use the weight (w1) to multiply p(w2)		

Attention:
 the ARPA format is  conditional probability  n-gram   weight.
1. both digits are negative
2. when multiplying the probabilities, add up
